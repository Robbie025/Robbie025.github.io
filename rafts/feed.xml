The three laws proposed by Issac Asimov is well known and has been captured in the movie iRobot. The other one are more rules for robots which i think is more practical in day to day life. I will simply present them here for you to reflect over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, robots are simply machines – A machine that can carry out tasks automatically – that should operate safely in human society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;laws-of-robots-by-issac-asimov&quot;&gt;Laws of Robots by Issac Asimov&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law 1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law 2: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law 3:  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rules-for-robots-by-yokomizo&quot;&gt;Rules for Robots by Yokomizo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 1: Robots must be made and used for the well-being and development of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 2: Robots must not replace people on jobs people want to do themselves but must replace people on jobs that they do not wish to do or believe to be hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 3:  Robots must be built to such specifications that they do not psychologically and physically oppress people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 4: Robots must follow the command of people so that they do not harm other people, only damaging themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 5: If robots replace people on certain jobs, the prior approval of the people affected must be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 6: Robots must be made so tht they can be easily operated by people and they can readily perform the role of assistants to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 7: As soon as robots finish their assigned tasks, they must depart from the place so they do not interfere with people and other robots.&lt;/p&gt;
