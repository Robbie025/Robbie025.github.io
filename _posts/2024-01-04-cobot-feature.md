# TLDR

One way of thinking of Collaborative Operations is to compare the functionality with fully automated robotic workstations. I want to highlight here that **Collaborative Operation** is an additional or complementary feature to traditional robotic installation.

The assumption being made here is: In a work cycle, the majority of the work will be done by the robot (not requiring human input) and some parts of thw cycle will be executed by or with a human. This second part of the work cycle is therefore a collabotive operation.  



# Collaboration - A Feature  

The motivation for this blog is simple. I have noticed that there are varied thoughts of what it means to collaborate with a machine from the point of view of a non-expert. There is also a lot of marketing fluff. This blog is to consolidate my understaning in a formal way and is not meant to be educative. That said, I hope you find it useful.

## Two Installations 

two stations with traditonal manipulators will be described here and is done so to set the context for the discussions that will follow. These installations are common though they are not recognised as collaborative.  

### Small factory with low automation.

The small factory was well-lit with only one robotized workstation  where the robot was approximately 15m away. I was not aware that the robot was currently operational. There were several humans, many of them were walking around freely. 

At some point, the host warned us that we cannot corss a line (yellow/black tape) upon which we noticed the line. It was a pretty obvious line if you knew what to look for and there were such marking everywhere. The reason being, it might trigger a safety-stop function which then require the integrator to come and restart the station.
This was a robotic workstation with no physical fence with a safety-stop functionality, which is a standardized safety mode for collaborative operations.  

### A large factory with several workstation

I noticed that there were no fences but there was obviously an entrance to a workstation with one or more industrial robots. The host mentioned that this was the next generation of robotic systems that don't require fences. This way of describing collaborative workstation is quite common. 

The entrance was however blocked by boxes (pallets) to prevent humans from walking into the workstation. Lack of situational awareness was not identified as a risk by the machine builders with quick and perhaps valid solutions to mitigate recurrent machine stops.


## Main Actors - Machine Builders & Manufacturers 

Robotic workstations are designed to be operated autonomously within a predefined boundary. The completely fenced safety solution are perfect for such operation. Robots are machines, and like all machines are designed, commissioned and operated  by a team. A team commonly referred to as integrators or machine builders typically design and commision the machine for manufacturers that operate the machine.

## Central Ideas

The mental-picture that pops up when we hear the term collaboration (with robots) is the notion of humans and machines working together in harmony. This is an ideal notion and still very hard to operationalize let alone assure safety.

**Collaborative Operations** is the standardized term that defines human-robot collaboration. Safety is a property of a machine and not a feature. **Collaborative workspace** specifies where the common physical space where human and the robot can co-exist to collaborate on a task. This workspace is part of the system-of-interest, which means that the robot can be programmed to enter this workspace. 

A task is thought of as part of a work cycle and excludes staart-up, ramp-up or maintenance tasks. The task is associated with the productive part of a machine and provides values to a manufacturer. A task can be sub-divided into two: what the machine does and those carried out by human. 

## A Feature?

A feature is a distinctive attribute or aspect of something, which in our context are robotic systems. The way I understand a robotic system  is as a well-defined set of machines (including the manipulator) that are integrated and commissioned as one single machine. 

Note here that in a non-collaborative station, human does not carryout productive task and usually undertake a supervisory role. In a collaborative station, humans actively participate in productive work.
The ability to collaborate is a feature designed into traditional robotic system. You could also think of it as a flexible way to operate a robotic workstation.

The design, integration and finally commission are carried out machine builders. The manufacturers (e.g., car manufacturer) generally speaking are purchasing solutions.

From a machine builder perspective, I assume that the ability for robots to collaborate is a feature that they need to developed, tested and deployed. That is, there is a automated mode and a collaborative mode. The assumption being made here is: In a work cycle, the majority of the work will be done by the robot (not requiring human input) and the other parts of thw cycle will be executed by or with a human.

The safety-related functionality in automated mode can be fixed and will remain relatively unchanged over time. Changes to robotic workstations over time are common and necessary. Risk mitigation solution in automated mode typically involves triggering a safety-rated stop or in some cases an emergency stop. 

The additional feature added onto a traditional robotic workstation is the funtionality for carrying out productive task without going into a safety-related stop. Collaborative Operations (see safety standard ISO 10218) support this kind of operation.

To add this feature to the machine, integrators will have to identify the collaborative workspace and how the robot can enter and exit the collaborative workspace. Risk assessment supports this activity.
