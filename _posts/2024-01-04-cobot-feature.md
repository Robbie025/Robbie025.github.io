title: Collaborative Operration is a Feature not to be taken lightly.
---

As of the year 2024, machies are still designed in a way so that it can operate autonomously within a very specific boundary. Robots are machines, and like all machines are designed, operated and commissioned by humans. 

The idea that pops up when we hear collaboration is the notion of humans and machines working together in harmony. This is an ideal notion and still very hard to operationalize let alone assure safety.

A feature is a distinctive attribute or aspect of something, which in our context are robotic systems. The way I understand a robotic system  is as a well-defined set of machines (including the manipulator) that are integrated and commissioned as one single machine. The integration and commissioning are carried out by a team simply referred to as integrators or machine builders.

From a machine builder perspective, the ability for robots to collaborate is a feature that they needs to developed, tested and deployed. 
Depending on the requirements, entering the collaborative workspace might have to be done frequently or very infrequently.

The safety standards essentially assert that, if collaborative operations were to be included as a feaure for a robotic system, there are three or four safety modes that can be deployed to enable this feature. The assumption is that the machine builders will carryout risk assessment, carry out verification and validation activities prior to machine deplayment. 

Consider that industrial robots come in various sizes. Even robots designed and marketed as collaborative robots have their relavant safety mode active only in pre-defined situations. 
The challenge for machine builders is to whether to include the ability to collaborate as part of their solution to those that will operate their machine for several years in the future.--
