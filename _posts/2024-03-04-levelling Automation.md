title: "Levelling Automation"
---

I use the phrase 'Levelling Automation' in a broad sense. It's simply interesting for me to think broadly, with specifics to exemplify the point.

1. **Proliferation of Automation Technology**: 
Currently, I believe certain industrial sectors are highly automated, whereas others, such as medical or chemical laboratories, are not. Automation could be made more accessible and available across different industries.

Industrial control systems, including safety controllers, are now more commonplace in the automation of apartment-complex. However, control systems at shipping docks (though I might be wrong here) are very different and follow different approaches.


2. **Standardizing Automation Practices**: 
This could involve developing industry-wide safety protocols, interoperability standards, or quality benchmarks to ensure that automation is implemented consistently and safely across various sectors.

Industrial robotic safety practices that have been in place for more than two decades are being adopted by the construction and mining industries.

3. **Balancing Human and Machine Roles**: 
"Levelling Automation' means an approach to integrating human workers and automated systems in a way that optimizes the strengths of both. I want to stress here that certain characteristics of automation and that of humans can be either variable or invariant over time.

A human interacting with automation over a long enough time, forms a mental model which allows them to react to emergencies.
This notion could be carried over to other aspects of human life.
A simple example is the left-hand drive and right-hand drive of cars. Some people can cope with this change. As another example, the principle of different colors in traffic lights should be uniform on roads, railways, robotic systems, or even in space.
