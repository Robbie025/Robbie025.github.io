title: Laws Of Robots
---

I found these two lars or rules of robotics to be interesting and something to reflect over when we build complex machines. The three laws proposed by Issac Asimov is well known and has been captured in the movie iRobot. The other one are more rules for robots which i think is more practical in day to day life. I will simply present them here for you to reflect over.

As of 2024, robots are simply machines -- A machine that can carry out tasks automatically -- that should operate safely in human society.

# Laws of Robots by Issac Asimov

Law 1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

Law 2: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

Law 3:  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.




# Rules for Robots by Yokomizo

Rule 1: Robots must be made and used for the well-being and development of people.

Rule 2: Robots must not replace people on jobs people want to do themselves but must replace people on jobs that they do not wish to do or believe to be hazardous.

Rule 3:  Robots must be built to such specifications that they do not psychologically and physically oppress people.

Rule 4: Robots must follow the command of people so that they do not harm other people, only damaging themselves.

Rule 5: If robots replace people on certain jobs, the prior approval of the people affected must be obtained.

Rule 6: Robots must be made so tht they can be easily operated by people and they can readily perform the role of assistants to people.

Rule 7: As soon as robots finish their assigned tasks, they must depart from the place so they do not interfere with people and other robots.
