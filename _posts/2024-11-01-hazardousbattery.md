title: "Battery Electric Vehicle - A Catch-22 technology?"
---

This post is slightly off-topic but is relevant from a public safety point fo view. I write this following a rather heated discussion on the topic of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) in India and why it is not taking off. There is a financial element to the discussion, which I will not focus on but understand that it is an important factor in the purchase of any vehicle.

I have heard in the news (and other sources) that clean energy was not a discussion point at all during the recent elections in India. The comment that resulted in me being accused of being a leftist was that people should buy electric vehicles. In my world it is implicit that you are not coerced to buy one, that would be a terrible place to be at for the consumer. However, I do mean that people should buy it, if they can afford it, even if it is more expensive than combustion vehicles.
 
Why would some one with disposable income prioritize an electric vehicle? In addition to zero tail-pipe emission, such vehicles have much better performance in terms of acceleration and overall operating efficiency. The performance might not be favorable for brake wear but electic motors can be used to regenerate power during braking.  I also think that ride comfort is better in electric cars, though some manufacturers in their attempt to reduce purchase cost have made the wrong trade-off.
 
So better performance, zero tail-pipe emissions, better ride comfort are the main reasons to consider prioritizing electric vehicles. Zero tail-pipe emissions and value for the general public seems to be at core of political discussions. Did i menation much less noise?  
 
Why should governments incentivize technologies that are currently much more expensive? Incentivising emission free technologies is a way to combat passive-smoking of carbon emissions from gasoline vehicles. This reason stands for households that continue to burn wood or kerosene inside their homes as well. This might be financially cheap in the short run, very expensive in the long run. Inhaling smoke passively have deterimental effects on cancer risk, intelligence or brain develoment as well as overal wellbeing. Currently, smoke from burning of fuels are unavoidable. In short, it is advantageous for the general public.
  
As always, mitigating risks of old technology is new technology. It should be significantly better. The most popular architecture are electric motors with power from battery systems. Batteries have been used in cars for several decades to start the engine. Now batteries by weight is significant part of a Battery Electric Vehicle. The point I am trying to make is keeping in mind what I seen over the years and points to costs for maintenance and treatment of non-functioning machines.
 
If you were to travel across India 20 years ago, you would find vehicles abandoned or left as it is after an accident. Such vehicles could be left to rot for many years. The questions is how could a battery system affect the environment if it has not blown up. The effect is of high severity even compared to a gasoline car. Petrol as well as Dielsel evaporate over time. The hazardous material are metals and plastics from the vehicle. Batteries in BEV are highly toxic materials that has the potential to significantly damage biological life, and my guess is more serously than fossil fuels.
 
It is easy to imagine battery powered planes or ships being rendered useless due to small technical failures. They might just be abandoned. What about earthquakes damaging large battery storage facilities. The disastor-vector are many with very serious consequences. This is scary and I need to investigate this issue more. Adpotion of BEV will help is understanding the trade-offs of this technology that is at the heart of electrification momentum.
