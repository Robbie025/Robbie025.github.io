### Current Ambitions

At the moment, i work as a FMEA leader at Volvo Consturction Equipment in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The role is broad but focussed on the driveline systems of wheel loaders, excavators and haulers. I have to interact with development engineers, system engineers, project managers etc., which makes me happy. 

The question that I am trying to figure out during my daily work is, how can current control measures - for reliable ans safe operations - that are dependent on the vigilance of human operators (similiar to a regular car driver) be transferred or engineered in autonomous machines. This question is forcing me to think acorss disciplines including legal manners and standardization.

Electrication is Volvo machines are ongoing and the benefits of electrified machines are good. The journey to full electrification is going to be long and implies how energy is transported and consumed.

### Overarching view of Technology

As a technologist, I believe engineers play an important role in making societies better through the use of technology. As a 40 (..ish) old engineer, I have worked with automation in manufacturing, contributed to standardization of industiral robots, design autmation with knowledge-based engineering as well design optimization research. I am most proud of my contribution to the question: 

```
          How can large robots collaborate with humans safely? 
```

I received my PhD on this topic from Linköping University. I have worked at Linköping University for around 10 years after receiving my Masters degree in Mechancial Engineering.
