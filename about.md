### Current Ambitions

At the moment, i work as a FMEA leader at Volvo Consturction Equipment in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The role is broad but focussed on the driveline systems of wheel loaders, excavators and haulers. I have to interact with development engineers, system engineers, project managers etc., which makes me happy. 

The question that I am trying to figure out during my daily work is, how can current control measures - for reliable & safe machines - that are currently dependent on the vigilance of human operators (similiar to a regular car driver) be transferred or engineered in autonomous systems. This question is forcing me to think across disciplines including legal manners and standardization.

Electrication is Volvo machines are ongoing and the benefits of electrified machines are good. The journey to full electrification is going to be long and implies how energy is transported and consumed.

### Overarching view of Technology

As a technologist, I believe engineers play an important role in making societies better through the use of technology. The purpose of Technology is being useful as opposed to Science which is a truth-seeking endevour.

As a 40 (..ish) old engineer, I have worked with automation in manufacturing, robotics, contributed to standardization, design autmation with knowledge-based engineering as well design optimization research. I am most proud of my contribution to the question, for which I received a PhD from Link√∂ping University:

```
          How can robots collaborate with humans safely? 
```

### Safety & Reliability

These are two separate engineerng topics. Currently, my view is: Do machines designed and delivered by large engineering teams operate reliabily over its life time and how can these teams assert reliability as a machine property.

Obviously, this is not a new question. This blog is meant to document safety engineering issues that I observe and comment on.
