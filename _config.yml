  Automation through technology has the potential to benefit society significantly.
  In this blog, I aim to explore the impact of technology across various industries, 
  with a particular focus on safety. 
  My goal is to understand and communicate the complex trade-offs involved in integrating 
  technology into our daily lives. 
  As technology becomes more prevalent, it prompts a 'leveling effect,' helping us to 
  better grasp these trade-offs and make informed decisions.
