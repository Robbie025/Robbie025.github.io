Posts that i am working on now:

1. Description of a dead mans switch. Safety functionality.
2. Performance levels Pl=D
3. Industrial robotic system - the need for better interfaces.
4. Why are industrial robotic systems expensive. 


  "Engineering Safer Future Systems with Robotics and Human Oversight" would be 
  the theme of this blog where I attempt the art of writing to understand the
  highly dynamic & wonderfully technical world we live in. See my post on Levelling 
  Automation if you are curious about what I eman by "Levelling Automation".

  This blog is focussed on concepts in automation, especially 
  when technical-systems interact or collaborate with human-systems. My current
  interests are in understanding concepts in Industrial systems as these 
  concepts seems to be moving from industrial environments to more broader sectors
  including mining, laboratories, marine etc.

  Automation with technology will be beneficial to society. This blog is a way for me to 
  comment on the use of technology across industries. Safety is the primary lens through which I make judgements while I attempt to understand and communivate. Levelling Automation means that I want automation technologies to be widely adopted across all industies.
